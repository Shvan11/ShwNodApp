# Google Drive PDF Upload - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: PDF Upload to Google Drive for Aligner Portal
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete PDF upload system that allows users (doctors and lab staff) to upload PDF files for aligner sets directly to Google Drive through the Aligner Portal. The system automatically organizes files, generates shareable links, and tracks uploads in the database.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Services

#### Google Drive Client (`services/google-drive/google-drive-client.js`)
- OAuth2 authentication with Google Drive API
- File upload and permission management
- Folder creation and organization
- Connection testing and error handling
- Auto-refresh of access tokens

#### Drive Upload Service (`services/google-drive/drive-upload.js`)
- High-level upload abstraction
- Patient/set-based file organization
- PDF validation (MIME type + magic bytes)
- Standardized filename generation
- File deletion and replacement

#### Upload Middleware (`middleware/upload.js`)
- Multer configuration for file uploads
- Memory storage (direct Drive upload)
- PDF-only file filter
- 100MB file size limit
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Portal Endpoints (`routes/portal.js`)
- `POST /api/portal/sets/:setId/upload-pdf` - Upload PDF for a set
  - Authenticates user
  - Validates PDF file
  - Gets patient/set information
  - Replaces old file if exists
  - Uploads to Google Drive
  - Updates database with URL and metadata

- `DELETE /api/portal/sets/:setId/pdf` - Delete PDF from a set
  - Removes file from Google Drive
  - Clears database fields

#### Admin Endpoints (`routes/admin.js`)
- `GET /api/admin/google-drive/auth-url` - Generate OAuth URL
- `GET /api/admin/google-drive/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `GET /api/admin/google-drive/test` - Test Drive connection
- `GET /api/admin/google-drive/status` - Check configuration status

### 3. Database Changes

Added to `tblAlignerSets`:
```sql
PdfUploadedAt DATETIME NULL         -- When PDF was uploaded
PdfUploadedBy NVARCHAR(255) NULL    -- Who uploaded (email)
DriveFileId NVARCHAR(255) NULL      -- Google Drive file ID
```

Existing field used:
```sql
SetPdfUrl NVARCHAR(2000) NULL       -- Public shareable link
```

Migration script: `migrations/add-pdf-tracking-fields.sql`

### 4. Frontend Components

#### React Component Updates (`AlignerPortalComponent.jsx`)
- `handlePdfUpload()` - Upload handler with validation
- `handlePdfDelete()` - Delete handler with confirmation
- Upload state management (loading, progress)
- File input with hidden input technique
- Conditional rendering (upload/replace/delete buttons)
- Success/error notifications

#### UI Features
- Upload button (green) when no PDF exists
- View PDF button (red) when PDF exists
- Replace PDF button (green) to update existing
- Delete PDF button (orange) to remove
- Loading spinner during upload
- Disabled state while uploading

#### Styling (`alignerportal.css`)
- Color-coded buttons for different actions
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive flex layout
- Spinner animation for upload state
- Disabled button styles

### 5. Configuration

#### Environment Variables (`config/config.js`)
```javascript
googleDrive: {
  clientId: GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID || GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET || GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI (auto-generated),
  refreshToken: GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN,
  folderId: GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID
}
```

#### Server Initialization (`index.js`)
- Import Drive client
- Initialize on startup
- Log initialization status
- Handle missing configuration gracefully

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/google-drive-setup.md` - Complete setup guide
- `docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE_FEATURE.md` - Feature overview
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- Inline code comments throughout

## Testing Checklist

### Setup Testing
- [ ] Install npm packages: `npm install`
- [ ] Create Google Cloud project
- [ ] Enable Google Drive API
- [ ] Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- [ ] Add credentials to `.env`
- [ ] Get refresh token via OAuth flow
- [ ] Test connection: `GET /api/admin/google-drive/test`
- [ ] Verify status: `GET /api/admin/google-drive/status`

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Start application and verify Drive client initializes
- [ ] Login to Aligner Portal
- [ ] Navigate to an aligner set
- [ ] Upload a PDF file (should succeed)
- [ ] Verify PDF link appears
- [ ] Click PDF link (should open in Drive)
- [ ] Replace the PDF with a new one
- [ ] Verify old file is deleted, new file uploaded
- [ ] Delete the PDF
- [ ] Verify file removed from Drive and database
- [ ] Check database fields populated correctly

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Try uploading non-PDF file (should reject)
- [ ] Try uploading >100MB file (should reject)
- [ ] Test with missing Drive credentials (should show warning)
- [ ] Test with invalid folder ID (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test with invalid refresh token (should show error)

### Security Testing
- [ ] Verify authentication required for upload
- [ ] Test that unauthenticated users cannot upload
- [ ] Verify files have public "anyone with link" permissions
- [ ] Check that old files are deleted on replacement
- [ ] Verify upload tracking (PdfUploadedBy field)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Google Drive?
- ✅ Generous free storage (15GB)
- ✅ Reliable uptime and CDN
- ✅ Easy sharing via public links
- ✅ No server storage requirements
- ✅ Automatic backups

### Why Memory Storage (Multer)?
- ✅ Direct upload to Drive (no disk I/O)
- ✅ Better for containerized environments
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after request
- ✅ No temp file management needed

### Why OAuth2?
- ✅ More secure than API keys
- ✅ Refresh tokens for long-term access
- ✅ Fine-grained permission control
- ✅ User authorization tracking

### Why Replace Instead of Versioning?
- ✅ Simpler implementation
- ✅ Saves storage space
- ✅ Meets current requirements
- ⚠️ Can add versioning later if needed

---

## Known Limitations

1. **File Size**: 100MB max (configurable, but reasonable for PDFs)
2. **File Type**: PDFs only (by design)
3. **Versioning**: No version history (replaces old file)
4. **Concurrent Uploads**: One file at a time per user
5. **Public Links**: Anyone with link can view (no password protection)

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):
- Bulk PDF upload for multiple sets
- PDF preview/thumbnail in portal
- Email notifications on upload
- Version history for PDFs
- Domain-restricted sharing (Google Workspace)
- Drag-and-drop upload interface
- Upload progress bar (percentage)
- Automatic PDF generation from templates
- OCR/text extraction from PDFs
- PDF annotation capabilities

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Authentication required for all uploads
- ✅ File type validation (MIME + magic bytes)
- ✅ File size limits enforced
- ✅ Upload tracking (who/when)
- ✅ OAuth2 secure authentication
- ✅ Refresh token rotation
- ✅ Environment variable for secrets

### Recommendations
- 🔒 Never commit `.env` to version control
- 🔒 Use separate credentials per environment
- 🔒 Rotate refresh tokens periodically
- 🔒 Monitor API usage in Google Console
- 🔒 Review folder permissions regularly
- 🔒 Consider domain-restricted sharing for production

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- Upload time: ~2-5 seconds for typical PDFs (2-5MB)
- Large files (50MB): ~10-20 seconds
- Database update: <100ms
- Link generation: <500ms

### Optimization Opportunities
- Compress PDFs client-side before upload
- Use resumable uploads for large files
- Implement upload queue for bulk operations
- Cache Drive folder IDs

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Check server logs for Drive initialization status
- Monitor Google Cloud Console for API errors
- Track failed uploads in database
- Review API quota usage regularly

### Troubleshooting
- See `docs/google-drive-setup.md` for common issues
- Test connection via admin endpoints
- Verify environment variables
- Check Google Cloud Console for API status

### Maintenance Tasks
- Rotate refresh tokens annually
- Review and clean up old PDFs
- Monitor storage usage in Drive
- Update googleapis package regularly
