# Cascading Sync Feature

## Overview

The queue processor now includes **automatic cascading sync** - when syncing a record to Supabase, it automatically fetches and syncs any missing parent records from SQL Server.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when a new aligner set was created in SQL Server:
1. ‚ùå Patient record was NOT synced (trigger only fires when patient has aligner sets)
2. ‚ùå Work record was NOT synced (trigger only fires when work has aligner sets)
3. ‚úÖ Set record was synced (direct trigger)

This caused foreign key violations in Supabase because the set referenced a `work_id` that didn't exist, and the work referenced a `person_id` that didn't exist.

## Solution: Self-Healing Sync

The queue processor now automatically:
1. Detects missing parent records when processing queue items
2. Fetches missing records from SQL Server
3. Syncs them to Supabase in the correct order (patient ‚Üí work ‚Üí set)

## How It Works

### Dependency Chain

```
aligner_batches
    ‚Üì (requires)
aligner_sets
    ‚Üì (requires)
work
    ‚Üì (requires)
patients
```

### Processing Flow

When syncing an **aligner_set**:
1. Check if referenced `work` exists in Supabase
2. If not, fetch work from SQL Server
3. Before syncing work, check if referenced `patient` exists
4. If not, fetch patient from SQL Server
5. Sync patient ‚Üí work ‚Üí set in order

When syncing an **aligner_batch**:
1. Check if referenced `aligner_set` exists in Supabase
2. If not, fetch set from SQL Server and cascade (set ‚Üí work ‚Üí patient)

When syncing **work**:
1. Check if referenced `patient` exists in Supabase
2. If not, fetch patient from SQL Server

## Example Output

```
üì¶ Processing 1 items from sync queue...
üîÑ Syncing aligner_sets ID 123 (INSERT)
  üì• Fetching missing work record (ID: 456) from SQL Server...
  üì• Fetching missing patient record (ID: 789) from SQL Server...
  ‚úÖ Patient record synced (ID: 789)
  ‚úÖ Work record synced (ID: 456)
üìù Attempting to mark QueueID 1 as Synced...
  ‚úÖ Synced successfully (UPDATE affected 1 rows)
‚úÖ Batch complete: 1 synced, 0 failed
```

## Benefits

1. **No Trigger Changes Needed** - SQL Server triggers remain unchanged
2. **Self-Healing** - Handles missing data from any source:
   - New patient/work insertions
   - Partial syncs due to previous errors
   - Manual data insertion in Supabase
   - Queue items processed out of order
3. **Data Integrity** - Prevents foreign key violations
4. **Automatic** - No manual intervention required

## Technical Details

### New Methods Added to `QueueProcessor`

#### `fetchPatientFromSqlServer(personId)`
Fetches patient record from SQL Server's `tblPatients` table.

**Returns:** Patient data object or null if not found

#### `fetchWorkFromSqlServer(workId)`
Fetches work record from SQL Server's `tblWork` table.

**Returns:** Work data object or null if not found

#### `fetchAlignerSetFromSqlServer(alignerSetId)`
Fetches aligner set record from SQL Server's `tblAlignerSets` table.

**Returns:** Aligner set data object or null if not found

#### `ensureRelatedRecordsExist(data, tableName)`
Recursively ensures all parent records exist in Supabase before syncing the current record.

**Parameters:**
- `data` - The record data being synced
- `tableName` - The table being synced ('patients', 'work', 'aligner_sets', 'aligner_batches')

**Logic:**
- For `aligner_sets`: Ensures work exists (which cascades to patient)
- For `work`: Ensures patient exists
- For `aligner_batches`: Ensures aligner_set exists (which cascades to work and patient)

### Error Handling

- If a parent record cannot be fetched from SQL Server, a warning is logged but the sync continues
- This prevents cascading failures while still providing visibility into issues
- Failed parent syncs don't block the child record from syncing

## Testing

To test the cascading sync:

1. **Create a new patient in SQL Server**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tblPatients (PatientName, FirstName, LastName, Phone)
   VALUES ('Test Patient', 'Test', 'Patient', '1234567890');
   ```

2. **Create a new work record for that patient**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tblWork (PersonID, Typeofwork, AdditionDate)
   VALUES (@PersonID, 1, GETDATE());
   ```

3. **Create a new aligner set for that work**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tblAlignerSets (WorkID, AlignerDrID, SetSequence, Type)
   VALUES (@WorkID, 1, 1, 'Full');
   ```

4. **Check the logs** - You should see:
   - Patient fetched and synced
   - Work fetched and synced
   - Set synced

5. **Verify in Supabase** - All three records should exist with correct relationships
