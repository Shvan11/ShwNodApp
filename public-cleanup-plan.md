# Comprehensive Public Directory Cleanup Plan

**Goal**: Clean public directory after JSX transformation, preserving only dashboard functionality and appointments.html screen view.

## IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNED

**Dashboard-linked HTML files should NOT be deleted** - they are minimal entry points that load JSX components, not legacy files. These HTML files provide the correct DOM structure (proper element IDs) that JSX components expect and should be preserved.

## Analysis Summary

### Dashboard Entry Point (index.html)
The dashboard links to these pages:
1. `./calendar.html` - Minimal HTML entry point that loads calendar.jsx
2. `./views/appointments/daily-appointments.html` - Minimal HTML entry point that loads daily-appointments.jsx
3. `./views/patient/search.html` - Patient search (legacy JS, needs JSX conversion)
4. `./views/messaging/send.html` - WhatsApp messaging (legacy JS, needs JSX conversion)
5. `./views/patient/add-patient.html` - Minimal HTML entry point that loads add-patient.jsx
6. `./views/messaging/auth.html` - WhatsApp authentication (preserve)
7. `./views/patient/grid_.html` - Minimal HTML entry point that loads grid.jsx

### Appointments Screen View (views/appointments.html)
Standalone screen view that:
- Uses `../css/main.css` and `../css/pages/appointments.css`
- Loads `../js/pages/appointments.js`
- Depends on appointments-shared.js and various services

### WhatsApp Authentication
Critical system component used by messaging features:
- `views/messaging/auth.html` - Authentication UI
- `js/components/whatsapp-auth.js` - Authentication logic
- `css/components/whatsapp-auth.css` - Authentication styles

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Backup and Verify
1. Create backup of current public directory
2. Verify dashboard loads correctly
3. Verify appointments.html loads correctly
4. Verify WhatsApp auth works

### Phase 2: Delete HTML Views - CORRECTED
```bash
# DELETE ONLY legacy HTML files (preserve JSX entry points AND dashboard-required files)
rm -rf views/messaging/send-message.html
rm -rf views/patient/add-visit_.html
rm -rf views/patient/details.html
rm -rf views/patient/payments_.html
rm -rf views/patient/react-shell.html
rm -rf views/xrays_.html

# DO NOT DELETE these files:
# calendar.html (loads calendar.jsx)
# views/appointments/daily-appointments.html (loads daily-appointments.jsx)
# views/patient/add-patient.html (loads add-patient.jsx)
# views/patient/grid_.html (loads grid.jsx)
# views/patient/search.html (dashboard-linked, needs JSX conversion)
# views/messaging/send.html (dashboard-linked, needs JSX conversion)
```

### Phase 3: Delete JavaScript Files - CORRECTED
```bash
# Delete safe JavaScript files only
rm js/App.jsx
rm js/pages/appointments2.js
rm js/pages/home.js
rm js/pages/patient-front.js
rm js/pages/send-message.js
rm js/components/clock.js
rm js/components/modal.js
rm js/components/progress-bar.js
rm js/components/table.js
rm js/services/api.js
rm js/services/navigationContext.js
rm js/services/patient.js
rm js/utils/navigation.js

# DO NOT DELETE these required files:
# js/pages/add-patient.jsx (JSX entry point)
# js/pages/calendar.jsx (JSX entry point)
# js/pages/daily-appointments.jsx (JSX entry point)
# js/pages/grid.jsx (JSX entry point)
# js/pages/patient-shell.jsx (JSX entry point)
# js/pages/search.js (required by views/patient/search.html)
# js/pages/send.js (required by views/messaging/send.html)
# js/components/react/ (all React components)
# js/components/shared/ (shared React components)
```

### Phase 4: Delete CSS Files - CORRECTED
```bash
# Delete only unused CSS files
rm -rf css/pages/add-visit.css
rm -rf css/pages/front.css
rm -rf css/pages/index.css
rm -rf css/pages/send-message.css
rm -rf css/pages/waform.css
rm -rf css/components/cards.css
rm -rf css/components/forms.css
rm -rf css/components/modal.css
rm -rf css/components/tables.css
rm -rf css/layouts/

# DO NOT DELETE these required CSS files:
# css/pages/canvas.css (used by patient-shell.jsx)
# css/pages/grid.css (used by patient-shell.jsx and grid.jsx)
# css/pages/payments.css (used by patient-shell.jsx)
# css/pages/search.css (used by views/patient/search.html)
# css/pages/send.css (used by views/messaging/send.html)
# css/pages/visits-summary.css (used by patient-shell.jsx)
# css/pages/xrays.css (used by patient-shell.jsx)
# css/components/appointment-calendar.css (used by calendar.jsx)
# css/components/buttons.css (used by calendar.jsx)
# css/components/sidebar-navigation.css (used by patient-shell.jsx)
# css/components/universal-header.css (used by multiple JSX files)
```

### Phase 5: Delete Libraries and Assets
```bash
rm -rf photoswipe/
rm -rf images/R.png
rm -rf images/phone.png
```

### Phase 6: CRITICAL - Fix CSS Imports
**IMPORTANT**: After deleting CSS files, you MUST update `css/main.css` to remove broken imports or Vite will fail with import errors.

Remove these broken imports from `css/main.css`:
```css
/* REMOVE THESE LINES */
@import 'layouts/grid.css';           /* DELETED DIRECTORY */
@import 'layouts/containers.css';     /* DELETED DIRECTORY */
@import 'layouts/navigation.css';     /* DELETED DIRECTORY */
@import 'components/forms.css';       /* DELETED FILE */
@import 'components/tables.css';      /* DELETED FILE */
@import 'components/modal.css';       /* DELETED FILE */
@import 'components/cards.css';       /* DELETED FILE */
```

Update to only import existing files:
```css
/* Component styles - only existing files */
@import 'components/buttons.css';
@import 'components/universal-header.css';
@import 'components/whatsapp-auth.css';
@import 'components/appointment-calendar.css';
@import 'components/sidebar-navigation.css';
```

### Phase 7: Final Verification
1. Test dashboard functionality
2. Test appointments.html screen view
3. Test WhatsApp authentication
4. Verify no broken links or missing resources
5. Verify Vite server starts without CSS import errors
